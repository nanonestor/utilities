# Minecraft 'Client side' modID list  

The **clientonlymods.txt** file here is provided as a curated list to help aid sorting Minecraft Java edition mods written for the Forge and Neoforge modloader systems.  It is supposed to **only** contain modIDs for mods which are client-side by design and have no added server side functionalies if placed server side.  

Many mods are forks and share the same modID, this makes the list using modIDs fairly efficient.  Filenames can change but the modIDs inside will remain the same.  

This curated list was created for use of the ['Universalator'](https://github.com/nanonestor/universalator/wiki) server management script but is available for anyone to obtain for their own project's use via github raw download, etc.  

- For any additions / removals / errors please create either a pull request or submit an github issues ticket, thanks!
